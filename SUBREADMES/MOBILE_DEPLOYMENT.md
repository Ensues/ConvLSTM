## 🎯 Phase 1: Model Optimization

### 1.1 Add Global Average Pooling (Critical)

**Objective**: Replace massive FC layer with efficient pooling operation

**Current Architecture Bottleneck**:
The last ConvLSTM hidden state has shape [B, 32, 128, 128], which gets flattened to [B, 524288] before passing through a fully connected layer with 524288 → 3 parameters (1,572,867 parameters total).

**Optimized Architecture**:
Using Global Average Pooling, the hidden state [B, 32, 128, 128] is reduced to [B, 32, 1, 1] through adaptive average pooling, then flattened to [B, 32]. The FC layer becomes 32 → 3 with only 99 parameters.

**Implementation Steps**:
In the file models/conv_lstm_classifier.py, modify the ConvLSTMModel class:
- In the `__init__()` method: Replace the large FC layer with an AdaptiveAvgPool2d layer (output size 1×1) followed by a smaller FC layer (hidden_dim[-1] → num_classes)
- In the `forward()` method: Replace the reshape operation with global average pooling before flattening to [B, 32]

**Expected Impact**:
- **Parameter Reduction**: 1,572,867 → 99 params (-99.99%)
- **Model Size**: 7.4 MB → ~1.5 MB (-80%)
- **Inference Speed**: 10-20% faster (less computation)
- **Accuracy Impact**: Expect 2-5% drop (acceptable)

**Validation**:
1. Modify model architecture as described above
2. Retrain model from scratch using train.py
3. Compare accuracy using tester.py (Target: Original Accuracy - 5% or better)

---

### 1.2 Model Pruning (Optional)[Not needed now]

**Objective**: Remove redundant connections in ConvLSTM layers

**Strategy**: L1 Unstructured Pruning
Remove 30% of the least important weights from ConvLSTM layers using L1 unstructured pruning. Iterate through Conv2d modules, apply L1 pruning to 30% of weights, then make the pruning permanent. After training, load the model, apply pruning, and save the pruned model.

**Expected Impact**:
- **Size Reduction**: Additional 20-30%
- **Speed Improvement**: 5-10% faster
- **Accuracy Impact**: < 1% drop

**When to Use**: If model is still > 2 MB after GAP implementation

---

### 1.3 Knowledge Distillation (Advanced, Optional)[Not needed now]

**Objective**: Train smaller "student" model to mimic larger "teacher"

**Strategy**:
Use a Teacher-Student approach where the Teacher is the original ConvLSTM with [64, 32] hidden dims and the Student is a smaller ConvLSTM with [32, 16] hidden dims. Implement a combined distillation loss function where the student learns both from the teacher's soft predictions (using KL divergence with temperature scaling) and from the true labels (using cross-entropy). Use alpha parameter (e.g., 0.7) to weight the distillation loss versus classification loss, and temperature (e.g., 3.0) to soften the probability distributions.

**Expected Impact**:
- **Size Reduction**: 50-60% smaller model
- **Accuracy**: Within 3-5% of teacher model
- **Training Time**: 2x longer

**When to Use**: If inference latency is still too high after other optimizations

---

## 🔧 Phase 2: Model Conversion

### 2.1 PyTorch → ONNX (Universal Format)

**Objective**: Convert PyTorch model to portable ONNX format

**Implementation**:
Load the trained PyTorch model, set it to evaluation mode, create a dummy input tensor matching the input shape [1, 30, 6, 128, 128], then use torch.onnx.export() with the following key settings:
- opset_version=12 for better compatibility
- do_constant_folding=True to optimize constants
- Define input/output names ('video_input', 'direction_output')
- Set dynamic_axes for batch_size flexibility
After export, verify the ONNX model using onnx.checker.check_model() to ensure validity.

**Validation**:
Load the ONNX model using onnxruntime, create a test input with shape [1, 30, 6, 128, 128], run inference, and verify the output shape is (1, 3).

**Visualization**:
Use Netron to visualize the model architecture by opening the .onnx file in the Netron application.

---

### 2.2 ONNX → TensorFlow (Intermediate Step)

**Objective**: Convert ONNX to TensorFlow format (required for TFLite)

**Implementation**:
Load the ONNX model, use the onnx-tf backend's prepare() function to convert it to TensorFlow representation, then export as SavedModel format.

**Note**: Some ONNX operations may not be fully supported. If conversion fails, consider direct PyTorch → TensorFlow conversion (not recommended) using libraries like pytorch2keras.

---

### 2.3 TensorFlow → TFLite + Quantization (Final Format)

**Objective**: Convert to TensorFlow Lite with INT8 quantization for mobile

**Implementation**:
Create a TFLiteConverter from the SavedModel directory. For INT8 quantization, enable optimizations and provide a representative dataset (generator function yielding 100-500 sample inputs). Configure full integer quantization with INT8 input/output types for best performance, or use dynamic range quantization (weights only) if no representative dataset is available. Convert the model and save to a .tflite file.

The representative dataset should be created from actual training/validation data, iterating through samples and yielding properly formatted numpy arrays with shape [1, 30, 6, 128, 128].

**Expected Sizes**:
- **Float32 TFLite**: ~1.5 MB
- **INT8 Quantized TFLite**: ~400-800 KB
- **Dynamic Range**: ~800 KB - 1 MB

**Validation**:
Load the TFLite model using tf.lite.Interpreter, allocate tensors, retrieve input/output details, then run inference with a test input. Verify the input shape [1, 30, 6, 128, 128] and output shape (1, 3), along with their data types (float32 or int8 depending on quantization).

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Validation & Benchmarking

### 3.1 Accuracy Validation

**Objective**: Verify model accuracy is maintained throughout optimization pipeline

**Pipeline Testing**:
Create a comparison function that runs inference on the same test dataset across all three formats (PyTorch, ONNX, TFLite). Load each model, iterate through the test_loader, collect predictions from all formats, and calculate accuracy metrics using sklearn. Compare results to ensure:
- ONNX accuracy is within 0.5% of PyTorch (numerical precision differences)
- TFLite Float32 is within 1% of PyTorch
- TFLite INT8 is within 2-5% of PyTorch (acceptable quantization loss)

Generate a classification report for each format showing precision, recall, and F1-score for all three classes (Front, Left, Right).

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- **ONNX Accuracy**: Within 0.5% of PyTorch (numerical precision differences)
- **TFLite Float32**: Within 1% of PyTorch
- **TFLite INT8**: Within 2-5% of PyTorch (acceptable quantization loss)

---

### 3.2 Latency Benchmarking

**Objective**: Measure inference speed on mobile-like CPU environment

**Implementation**:
Create a benchmarking function that loads the TFLite model, performs warmup runs (10 iterations) to stabilize performance, then measures latency over 100 inference runs. Use high-precision timing (time.perf_counter) to capture start/end times for each run. Calculate comprehensive statistics: mean, median, standard deviation, min/max, percentiles (P95, P99), and throughput (FPS). This provides a complete performance profile showing typical inference time and worst-case scenarios.

**Performance Targets** (CPU-only, single thread):
| Device | Target Latency | Status |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| Desktop CPU | < 100 ms | ✅ Expected |
| High-end Mobile (Pixel 6, S21) | < 300 ms | 🎯 Target |
| Mid-range Mobile (Moto G, A52) | < 500 ms | ⚠️ Acceptable |
| Low-end Mobile | < 1000 ms | ❌ Too slow |

---

### 3.3 Model Size Verification

**Implementation**:
Create a utility function that iterates through all model files, checks their existence, calculates file sizes in both MB and KB, and displays a formatted comparison table. Compare across all formats: Original PyTorch (.pth), Optimized PyTorch (GAP), ONNX (.onnx), TensorFlow SavedModel, TFLite Float32, and TFLite INT8.

**Size Targets**:
- **Optimized PyTorch**: 1.5-2 MB
- **TFLite INT8**: < 1 MB (ideal: 500-800 KB)
